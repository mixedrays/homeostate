# @homeostate/store-valtio

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 314e268: Sync keys named after `Object.prototype` members, and stop peers from replacing object
  prototypes through a `__proto__` key. `getChanges` and the sync engine compared keys with `in`,
  so keys such as `constructor` or `toString` counted as always present and their deletions never
  replicated; the Valtio adapter had the same fault. A `__proto__` key is now never diffed and is
  left out of remote state at any depth. The Yjs and Loro backends' `read()` turned a peer's
  `__proto__` entry into an object's prototype, so its properties, such as `isAdmin`, appeared on
  other users' state; it now returns plain objects.
- 732c2c8: Apply a remote removal, insertion or move as an array splice. The adapter compared arrays by
  index, so removing the first of 1000 todos rewrote every later proxy with its successor's data
  and gave every row a new snapshot; the rows around a change now keep their snapshots.

### Minor Changes

- 81d1d18: Stop exporting the adapter classes (`JotaiAdapter`, `MobxAdapter`, `MobxStateTreeAdapter`, `ReduxAdapter`, `TanStackStoreAdapter`, `ValtioAdapter`, `ZustandAdapter`); create adapters with the `create*Adapter` factories, which now carry the adapter docs and examples.
